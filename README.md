### Description
This is a repo for the Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets (NLP with Disaster Tweets) Kaggle Competition. Due to the english language having certain words
be slang and not quite literal to the intended meaning of the actual word, some tweets may sound off. This project is an attempt to create a Natural Language Process code
that deciphers and identifies whether a tweets is announcing a literal diaster or if the tweet is being metaphorical.
